  <h3 align="left">Abstract</h3>
  <p align="left">Alzheimer’s Disease is an extremely prevalent neurodegenerative disease with over six million cases in the US. This disease causes progressive cognitive decline via tau pathology, which is a consequence of misfolded proteins. It starts in the locus coeruleus, proceeding to the transentorhinal cortex, then to other limbic and cortical areas. Current FDA-approved medications such as memantine, donepezil, and aducanamab are ineffective at halting degeneration. Understanding how mechanistically we need to treat tau pathology will generate more effective therapeutics and was the basis of a tau propagation model that investigated therapeutic efficacy based on neuronal survival rate. However, since there was no method for administering the treatment, the premise behind this project was embedding such therapeutics in biodegradable nanoparticles that could travel through arteries and reach the transentorhinal cortex. A hemodynamic model was created based on the Hagen–Poiseuille and Bernoulli equations to find the arterial velocity in blood flow and simulate the attachment of nanomotors. The results identified time for arterial travel and minimum amount and speed of nanomotors. A statistical test indicated that using at least 18 mm of nanomotors is beneficial for a lower total time. The in silico model was validated through comparison with an in vivo ultrasound case study for arterial blood velocity, which revealed that the model had physical limitations, but was still suggestive of major trends. The results favorably portrayed the nanoparticle’s biological realism, making it a suitable candidate for potentially reversing Alzheimer’s Disease with negligible invasiveness.</p>
